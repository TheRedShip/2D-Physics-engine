# 2D-Physics-engine

This repository comprises the source code for a 2D physics engine implemented in JavaScript, entirely from scratch without reliance on any external physics libraries. The engine is capable of simulating ball collisions, gravitation and other things, adhering to real-world physical laws such as the law of conservation of energy.
